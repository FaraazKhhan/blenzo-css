# Blenzo CSS (ver-1.0)

---

Blenzo CSS is a custom made CSS utility classes library.
It was created for my own use, because I am too lazy to design my buttons, headings again and again, only if they follow same theme.

#### Simple add these imports according to your prefence and add class-list mentioned below as per need.

- Standard File:

  > https://github.com/FaraazKhhan/blenzo-css/css/blenzo.css

- Minified version:

  > https://github.com/FaraazKhhan/blenzo-css/css/blenzo-min.css

## Here are some example:

---

- **Buttons**

  - > btn
  - > btn-accent
  - > btn-accent2
  - > btn-warning
  - > btn-info
  - > btn-danger
  - > btn-mute

_(Note: Accent and Accent2 are my personal favourite colors (Purplish and Greenish), so gave them their buttons too)_

- **Button Sizes**

  - > btn-sm
  - > btn-lg

- **Button with icons**

  - > btn-link-icon
  - > btn-home-icon

- **Margins**

  - > mx-auto
  - > m-1, m-2, m-3, m-4
  - > my-1, my-2, my-3, my-4
  - > mx-1, mx-2, mx-3, mx-4

- **Paddings**
  - > p-1, p-2, p-3, p-4
  - > py-1, py-2, py-3, py-4
  - > px-1, px-2, px-3, px-4

_(Note: Paddings and Margins are based on EM units, which is best in resizing.)_

- **Headings**

  - > heading
  - > sub-heading
  - > pre-heading

- **Titles (section-title)**

  - > section-title
  - > section-subtitle
  - > section-pretitle

- **Forms**

    - > input-wrapper

  - Form Label

    - > form-label

  - Form Input, and Textarea
    - > form-control

- **Section Size**

  - > section-sm

- **Social-media Icons Container**
